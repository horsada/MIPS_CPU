# Meeting Notes

## 23/11

- Start on instruction test benches now as they are irrespective of CPU implementation.

- OPCODE is 6 bits.

Split opcode instruction so that each person does 9 instructions:
- Simon: ANDI to BNE (inclusive)
- PV: DIV to LH
- Salman: LHU to MULTU
- Myriam: OR to SLTIU
- Adam: SLTU to XORI

Tasks for 25/11:
- OPCODE's finished and commented.
- Start on the respective test benches.
