# Meeting Notes

## 23/11

Start on instruction test benches now as they are irrespective of CPU implementation.

OPCODE is 6 bits.

Split opcode instruction so that each person does 9 instructions:
Simon: ANDI - BNE (inclusive)
PV: DIV - LH
Salman: LHU - MULTU
Myriam: OR - SLTIU
Adam: SLTU - XORI

Tasks for 25/11:
- OPCODE's finished and commented.
- Start on the respective test benches.
